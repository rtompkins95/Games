Various C++ game projects that I've been 
working on over the years. 

So far:
Zombie_Arena (2013) - A game inspired by various twin stick shooters, but 
with features like Matrix bullet time. Implemented in with C++ and Allegro5 framework
for graphics, audio, etc.. 

Platformer (2015-current) - Basis of a platformer in C++ with SFML
Work in progress!
